# TestExplorer

A lightweight, reusable, dependency-free C++20 testing framework designed around a clean and extensible test execution architecture.

> **Status:** Early Development — API and architecture are subject to change.

## Overview

**TestExplorer** is an experimental C++ testing framework built from the ground up with a focus on:

- Clean architecture
- Separation of responsibilities
- Reusability
- Extensibility
- Explicit execution flow
- Minimal dependencies
- Reliable test execution

The project is designed to provide a reusable testing library that can gradually evolve toward features commonly found in modern testing frameworks and IDE test explorers.

Development is intentionally incremental. The execution core is established and validated first, while higher-level capabilities are introduced as separate, testable milestones.

---

## Current Features

The current implementation provides:

- `TestCase`
- `TestContext`
- `TestFailure`
- `TestResult`
- `TestRegistry`
- `TestRunner`
- Assertion functions
- User-facing assertion macros
- Explicit test registration
- Test lookup by ID
- Single-test execution
- Run-all execution
- Test filtering
- Failed-test reruns
- Failure collection
- Execution timing
- C++20 `std::source_location` support
- Current test context management
- Exception handling during test execution
- Error result reporting
- Reporter abstraction
- Console reporter
- Framework self-tests

---

## Assertions

TestExplorer provides a user-facing assertion API through simple macros:

```cpp
EXPECT_TRUE(condition);
EXPECT_FALSE(condition);
EXPECT_EQ(actual, expected);
EXPECT_NE(actual, expected);
```

For example:

```cpp
TestCase test(
    "math.addition",
    "Addition Test",
    [](TestContext&)
    {
        EXPECT_EQ(2 + 2, 4);
        EXPECT_TRUE(10 > 5);
    }
);
```

The assertion macros provide a clean test-writing interface while the underlying assertion functions remain responsible for performing the actual checks and recording failures.

Assertion failures currently include:

- Failure messages
- Expected values where applicable
- Actual values where applicable
- `std::source_location`

For example:

```text
Expected values to be equal
Expected: world
Actual:   hello
```

The reported source location points to the actual assertion call inside the test.

---

## Basic Usage

A typical TestExplorer workflow consists of:

1. Define a test using `TestCase`
2. Register the test with `TestRegistry`
3. Execute the tests using `TestRunner`
4. Inspect the resulting `TestResult` objects

### 1. Define a Test

A test is represented by a `TestCase`.

The test body receives a `TestContext`, while the public assertion API accesses the active context automatically through TestExplorer's current-context mechanism.

```cpp
TestCase test(
    "math.addition",
    "Addition Test",
    [](TestContext&)
    {
        EXPECT_EQ(2 + 2, 4);
        EXPECT_TRUE(10 > 5);
    }
);
```

### 2. Register the Test

Tests are explicitly registered in a `TestRegistry`:

```cpp
TestRegistry registry;

registry.registerTest(test);
```

Multiple tests can be registered in the same registry:

```cpp
registry.registerTest(additionTest);
registry.registerTest(subtractionTest);
registry.registerTest(multiplicationTest);
```

### 3. Run the Tests

A `TestRunner` executes tests and produces a `TestResult` for each execution:

```cpp
TestRunner runner;

const auto results = runner.runAll(registry);
```

### Complete Example

```cpp
#include <TestExplorer/Assertions.hpp>
#include <TestExplorer/TestCase.hpp>
#include <TestExplorer/TestRegistry.hpp>
#include <TestExplorer/TestRunner.hpp>

using namespace testexplorer;

int main()
{
    TestCase test(
        "math.addition",
        "Addition Test",
        [](TestContext&)
        {
            EXPECT_EQ(2 + 2, 4);
            EXPECT_TRUE(10 > 5);
        }
    );

    TestRegistry registry;
    registry.registerTest(test);

    TestRunner runner;

    const auto results = runner.runAll(registry);
}
```

---

## Test Results

Each test execution produces a `TestResult` containing:

- Test ID
- Test name
- Execution status
- Execution duration
- Assertion failure information
- Error information when execution fails with an exception

Current statuses are:

```cpp
enum class TestStatus
{
    Passed,
    Failed,
    Skipped,
    Error
};
```

### `Passed`

The test executed normally and produced no assertion failures.

### `Failed`

The test executed normally, but one or more assertions failed.

### `Skipped`

Reserved for tests that are intentionally not executed.

### `Error`

The test execution was interrupted by an exception.

For example:

```cpp
TestCase test(
    "database.connection",
    "Database Connection",
    [](TestContext&)
    {
        throw std::runtime_error("Connection failed");
    }
);
```

The resulting status is:

```cpp
TestStatus::Error
```

and the exception message is available through:

```cpp
result.errorMessage();
```

For standard exceptions, `errorMessage()` contains `what()`.

For unknown exception types, the current message is:

```text
Unknown exception
```

Assertion failures and execution errors are intentionally represented separately.

---

## Test Filtering and Single Test Execution

TestExplorer supports selecting tests before execution through a lightweight filtering API.

A filter is represented by:

```cpp
using TestFilter =
    std::function<bool(const TestCase&)>;
```

The filter receives each registered `TestCase` and returns:

- `true` → execute the test
- `false` → exclude the test

For example, to execute only tests whose IDs start with `math.`:

```cpp
const auto results = runner.runAll(
    registry,
    [](const TestCase& test)
    {
        return test.id().starts_with("math.");
    }
);
```

### Single Test Execution

A single registered test can be executed directly by its ID:

```cpp
const TestResult result =
    runner.run(registry, "math.addition");
```

The registry-aware overload resolves the requested test through `TestRegistry` and delegates the actual execution to:

```cpp
run(const TestCase&)
```

If the requested test ID does not exist, `std::invalid_argument` is thrown.

Single-test execution uses the same execution lifecycle as normal test execution, including:

- Test context management
- Exception handling
- Execution timing
- Result generation
- Reporter notifications

---

## Run Failed Tests

TestExplorer can rerun tests that previously failed.

The API is:

```cpp
std::vector<TestResult> runFailed(
    const TestRegistry& registry,
    const std::vector<TestResult>& previousResults
);
```

Only results with:

```cpp
TestStatus::Failed
```

are selected for rerun.

Results with the following statuses are ignored:

- `Passed`
- `Skipped`
- `Error`

Example:

```cpp
const auto firstRun =
    runner.runAll(registry);

const auto failedResults =
    runner.runFailed(
        registry,
        firstRun
    );
```

The failed-test execution path delegates actual execution to:

```cpp
run(const TestCase&)
```

This keeps execution behavior consistent between:

- Single-test execution
- Run-all execution
- Filtered execution
- Failed-test reruns

If a previously failed test is no longer registered, it is ignored.

`runFailed()` does not store previous results inside `TestRunner`; the caller owns the previous result set.

---

## Reporting

TestExplorer separates test execution from result presentation through the `TestReporter` abstraction.

A reporter receives lifecycle events:

```cpp
testStarted(...);
testFinished(...);
testRunFinished(...);
```

A reporter can therefore observe individual test execution as well as the completion of an entire test run.

### Console Reporter

The current implementation includes `ConsoleReporter`:

```cpp
#include <TestExplorer/ConsoleReporter.hpp>

ConsoleReporter reporter(std::cout);

TestRunner runner(&reporter);

const auto results =
    runner.runAll(registry);
```

The console reporter displays:

- Test name
- Test ID
- Status
- Execution duration
- Assertion failure messages
- Failure source locations
- Execution error messages
- Test run summary

Example:

```text
Math Addition [math.addition]: PASSED | 400 ns
Math Subtraction [math.subtraction]: PASSED | 400 ns
Database Connection [database.connection]: ERROR | 1200 ns
  Error: Connection failed

=== Test Run Finished ===
Tests: 3
```

The reporter is injected into `TestRunner` as a non-owning dependency.

This keeps the execution core independent from a specific output format.

Future reporters can therefore be introduced without changing the core execution model.

---

## Exception Handling

Exception handling is part of the execution core.

A test throwing an exception must not terminate the entire test run.

For example:

```cpp
TestCase test(
    "exceptions.runtime_error",
    "Runtime Error",
    [](TestContext&)
    {
        throw std::runtime_error("Something went wrong");
    }
);
```

The runner converts the exception into an error result:

```text
TestStatus::Error
```

and execution continues with the next registered test.

### Standard Exceptions

Standard exceptions are handled through:

```cpp
catch (const std::exception& exception)
```

The result stores:

```cpp
exception.what()
```

as its error message.

### Unknown Exceptions

Unknown exception types are also handled:

```cpp
catch (...)
```

The current error message is:

```text
Unknown exception
```

### Context Cleanup

The active `TestContext` is temporary execution state.

TestExplorer guarantees that the current context is cleared even when test execution throws.

This prevents a failed exception path from leaving a stale context behind.

The cleanup mechanism uses RAII so that context cleanup is tied to scope lifetime rather than relying on every execution path to call cleanup manually.

---

## A More Realistic Example

Tests can contain multiple operations and assertions.

TestExplorer does not impose a limit on the complexity of the test logic itself.

```cpp
TestCase test(
    "vector.operations",
    "Vector Operations",
    [](TestContext&)
    {
        std::vector<int> values = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

        EXPECT_EQ(values.size(), 5);
        EXPECT_EQ(values.front(), 1);
        EXPECT_EQ(values.back(), 5);

        values.push_back(6);

        EXPECT_EQ(values.size(), 6);
        EXPECT_TRUE(values[5] == 6);
    }
);
```

The framework is responsible for:

- Executing the test
- Managing its execution context
- Collecting assertion failures
- Measuring execution time
- Handling execution exceptions
- Producing the corresponding `TestResult`
- Reporting execution results when a reporter is configured

The logic being tested remains entirely within the test itself.

---

## Architecture

TestExplorer is built around independent components with clearly separated responsibilities.

                                             TestFailure
```

The intended dependency direction is:

```text
Consumer Tests / CLI / Examples
            │
            ▼
      TestExplorer Library
```

The execution core does not depend on a specific reporting implementation.

```

## TestCase

`TestCase` represents a test definition.

A `TestCase` contains:

- Test ID
- Test name
- Test function

A `TestCase` does **not** store the result of its execution.

This separation allows the same test definition to be executed multiple times while each execution produces an independent `TestResult`.

---

## TestRegistry

`TestRegistry` is responsible for storing and organizing registered tests.

It currently provides:

- Test registration
- Access to registered tests
- Test lookup by ID

The registry does not execute tests.

This keeps test discovery and storage separate from execution.

---

## TestRunner

`TestRunner` is responsible for executing tests and producing `TestResult` objects.

It currently handles:

- Individual test execution
- Single-test execution by ID
- Running all registered tests
- Test filtering
- Failed-test reruns
- Execution timing
- Assertion failure collection
- Exception handling
- Status determination
- Active `TestContext` management
- Reporter notification

The runner does not:

- Perform assertion comparisons
- Store the test registry
- Format console output
- Implement a specific reporting format

### Core Execution API

```cpp
TestResult run(
    const TestCase& test
);

TestResult run(
    const TestRegistry& registry,
    const std::string& testId
);

std::vector<TestResult> runAll(
    const TestRegistry& registry
);

std::vector<TestResult> runAll(
    const TestRegistry& registry,
    TestFilter filter
);

std::vector<TestResult> runFailed(
    const TestRegistry& registry,
    const std::vector<TestResult>& previousResults
);
```

The registry-aware `run()` overload resolves a test by its registered ID and delegates execution to:

```cpp
run(const TestCase&)
```

The same execution path is reused by selection-based APIs.

If the requested test cannot be found, the runner throws `std::invalid_argument`.

---

## TestContext

`TestContext` represents the execution context of a single test.

Currently, it stores assertion failures generated during test execution.

A fresh context is created for each test execution.

The context is not reused between test executions.

---

## CurrentTestContext

`CurrentTestContext` provides temporary access to the `TestContext` associated with the currently executing test.

Its purpose is to keep the user-facing assertion API simple:

```cpp
EXPECT_EQ(actual, expected);
```

instead of requiring:

```cpp
expectEqual(context, actual, expected);
```

The current context is stored using `thread_local` state so that the mechanism does not depend on a process-wide shared context.

The active context is cleared after execution, including exception paths.

---

## TestFailure

`TestFailure` represents a single assertion failure.

A failure currently contains:

- Failure message
- Expected value where applicable
- Actual value where applicable
- `std::source_location`

This allows the framework to report not only what failed, but also where the assertion was made.

Execution exceptions are intentionally **not** represented as `TestFailure` objects.

They belong to the `Error` result state instead.

---

## TestResult

`TestResult` represents the result of one test execution.

It contains:

- Test ID
- Test name
- Status
- Execution duration
- Assertion failures
- Error message when execution fails with an exception

Keeping `TestResult` separate from `TestCase` allows one test definition to produce multiple independent execution results.

Example:

```cpp
if (result.status() == TestStatus::Error)
{
    std::cout
        << result.errorMessage()
        << '\n';
}
```

---

## TestReporter

`TestReporter` defines the reporting interface used to separate test execution from result presentation.

The reporter abstraction currently provides:

```cpp
testStarted(...);
testFinished(...);
testRunFinished(...);
```

The current implementation includes:

- `ConsoleReporter`

Future reporters may include:

- JSON reporter
- XML reporter
- IDE-oriented reporters
- Other structured output formats

The goal is to add reporting capabilities without coupling those output formats to `TestRunner`.

---

## Design Goals

### Separation of Responsibilities

Test registration, execution, assertions, results, filtering, and reporting should remain independent components.

### Reusability

The core framework should be usable as a library rather than being tied to a single application or IDE.

### Minimal Dependencies

The framework should rely primarily on the C++ standard library.

### Extensibility

The architecture should allow features such as reporters, filtering, fixtures, and parameterized tests to be added without rewriting the core execution model.

### Clear Execution Model

A test definition should remain independent from the result of its execution.

### Explicit Test Selection

Test selection should remain separate from execution so that future features such as tags, groups, and CLI filters can build on the same execution model.

### Reliable Execution

An exception inside one test should produce an error result rather than terminating the entire test run.

### Incremental Development

Features should be introduced in small, testable milestones rather than building the entire framework at once.

---

## Current Non-Goals

The following are intentionally outside the current scope:

- Graphical test explorer
- Reflection system
- Plugin architecture
- Distributed test execution
- Dependency injection
- Complex matcher framework
- Premature parallel execution

These may be reconsidered later if actual project requirements justify them.

---

## Project Status

TestExplorer is an experimental open-source project under active development.

The API is **not stable** and may change significantly before the first release.

The current implementation has established and validated:

- Core test execution
- Assertion handling
- Failure collection
- Test filtering
- Single-test execution
- Failed-test reruns
- Reporter abstraction
- Console reporting
- Exception-safe test execution
- Error result handling
- Framework self-tests

The next development focus is expanding test lifecycle and organization capabilities while keeping the core architecture small and maintainable.

---

## License

A project license will be added before the first public release.
